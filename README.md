Used Git Feature Branch Workflow https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow


Requiremen:
At least 12 cards are displayed initially face down. Maximum of 30 cards. 
There should be a theme to the cards and not just random images.
The cards should all be the same dimension. (grid should not look messy)
Should have at least 3 rows of cards.
There cannot be duplicate paired cards. (For example, you cannot have 4 cards that are ace of spades)
These cards should be shuffled upon pressing a button called “New Game”
User should be able to reset the game at any point with the "New Game" button
The user can only select two cards per turn.
If those selections match, those cards stay upright (can also have them become transparent or other styling choices indicating they are matched)
If the selections do not match, there should be a delay and then the cards should turn face down again
While the cards are being compared, other card selections should be disabled
Should be deployed on Github Pages.
No design frameworks allowed! Includes but is not limited to Bootstrap, Material-UI, Foundation, etc. Please email me if you are concerned that your approach may break this rule)
Must use useState hook for handling the state of the game.
Should contain a live counter for how many turns made so far.
Announce when the game is completed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
